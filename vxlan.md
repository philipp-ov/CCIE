## Concepts   
- RFC 7348
- VXLAN (Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network) is a Layer 2 overlay technology over a Layer 3 underlay infrastructure. It provides a means to stretch the Layer 2 network by pro- viding a tunneling encapsulation using MAC addresses in UDP (MAC in UDP) over an IP underlay. It is used to carry the MAC traffic from the individual VMs in an encapsulated for- mat over a logical “tunnel”
- UDP encapsulation, port 4789, 50 bytes overhead
- MTU should be large
- Only transport requirement is unicast IP
- VLAN numbers can be different on all switches, but VNI number should be the same 
- Default gateway can be any device in a fabric
- VxLAN does not encapsulate CDP, STP....
- VxLAN cannot do traffic engineering, that is why MPLS is better
- VxLAN L2 is the same as VPLS
- VxLAN tunnels are not statefull - no keepalives
- VxLAN producers - Huawei, Juniper, Nexus 9k and Arista

## Components
- VNID - Vxlan Network Identifier - defines broadcast segment - transfered in VxLAN header - 3 bytes
- NVE - Network Virtualization Edge - interface where VXLAN ends - only 1 NVE interface is allowed on the switch.
- VTEP - VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint - Nexus - Leaf
- EVI - EVPN Virtual Instance

## Pros
- Addresses the limitation of 4094 VLANs, allows 16M networks via VNI
- All paths are used via ECMP, UDP source port entropy ensures efficient load balancing
- Semaless moving VMs across DC

## How they handle BUM traffic and MAC learning
Can be processed in 2 ways:
- Multicast replication for BUM/Flood and learn for MAC - multicast is enabled on Underlay - BUM is not packed inside VxlAN - it is sent via Underlay - replication point is on rendezvous point - spine - it is difficult to configure multicast on Underlay - not used today
- Ingress replication for BUM/Flood and learn for MAC - packed to VxLAN - and sent to all in VNI - configured statically: for every VNI we configure VTEPs IPs which have the same VNI
- OVSDB for MAC learning and BUM
- EVPN for both BUM and MAC learning

## Operations
### Without BGP, ingress replication of BUM traffic
Host A in VLAN 1 SVI 1 sends ARP request for Host B in VLAN 2 svi 1. VTEP 1 encapsulates this ARP request to VXLAN and sends it to peer VTEPs for this SVI. VTEP 2 replies, and then all other traffic goes between these 2 VTEPs

### With BGP, ingress replication traffic
- Host A is online, Leaf-1 sees its MAC and forwards Route Type 2 to all other VTEPS, and now all VTEPs know that Host A is behind Leaf-1
- Host A in VLAN 1 SVI 1 sends ARP request for Host B in VLAN 2 svi 1
- Leaf 1 sends this ARP request in VXLAN to all VTEPs from which it got Route Type 3 - Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag with SNI 1
- All VTEPs which got ARP, forward it to all physical ports in this SVI
- Host B replies and Leaf 2 sends reply in VXLAN to Leaf 1

### BUM traffic via Multicast
- Host sends broadcast
- Leaf forwards it without VXLAN as a multicast to 225.2.2.1
- We configure a match between VNI and multicast address - only one multicast packet - Spines will propogate it to all subscribers - load is much less then ingress replication

## Host mobility
- VM moves from one VTEP to another and continue
- VTEP-2 creates route type 2 with higher Sequence Number
- All other VTEPs get a new route
- Route with higher sequence number wins
- Problems may appear if MAC is configured staticly on port

## Service models
When L2 services are configured: VTEP knows nothing about IP addresses, only MAC addresses and where they are located (VTEP IP address)
- VLAN based service: one VLAN - one MAC VRF (RT, RD) - one bridge table, Ethernet Tag = 0 - one VNI - forwarding based on VNI - most popular - good for multi vendor - one subnet per EVI - EVPN route type 2
- VLAN bundle service - one bridge table, MAC VRF with RT RD for all VLANs - frames are sent with 802.1Q - Ethernet Tag = 0, MACs in different VLANs should not match
- VLAN aware bundle service - not supported by all vendors - all VLANs have one VRF(RT, RD) - every VLAN has its own bridge table with VNI and Ethernet tag = VNI
- IP VRF to IP VRF

## Load balancing
The Layer 3 routes that form VXLAN tunnels use per-packet load balancing by default, which means that load balancing is implemented if there are ECMP paths to the remote VTEP. This is different from normal routing behavior in which per-packet load balancing is not used by default. (Normal routing uses per-prefix load balancing by default.)  
  
The source port field in the UDP header is used to enable ECMP load balancing of the VXLAN traffic in the Layer 3 network. This field is set to a hash of the inner packet fields, which results in a variable that ECMP can use to distinguish between tunnels (flows).  
  
None of the other fields that flow-based ECMP normally uses are suitable for use with VXLANs. All tunnels between the same two VTEPs have the same outer source and destination IP addresses, and the UDP destination port is set to port 4789 by definition. Therefore, none of these fields provide a sufficient way for ECMP to differentiate flows.    
That is why UDP is used, not IP for example.  
All VxLAN packets from one Leaf to another have different UDP source ports for load balancing purposes.

## Static configuration - Flood and learn
It is called flood and learn. No control plane is used. First packet (ARP) and broadcast are sent to all peers, configured for this VNI. All next packets are sent only to particular VTEP. VxLAN packets between leafs are load balanced between spines

## Firewall injection
- Connected to border leaf via TRUNK interface
- All required subinterfaces are configured on firewall
- On all required clients we configure firewall as a default gateway
- All traffic between VLANs goes via firewall
- Bottle neck for the entire network
- High load on border leaf
- ePBR can be also used

## MAC VRF
- RD:MAC-PREFIX:ETI
- RD:IP-PREFIX:ETI
- MAC-PREFIX = MAC/48
- Ethernet Tag ID = 0 - in most cases - defines bridge table inside VRF - several bridge tables can be in one vrf - in most cases we add 1 vlan to one MAC VRF, this is required only when several VLANs are in 1 MAC VRF
- We add VLAN to MAC VRF instead of interface in IP VRF

## Configuration

### Static peers on Nexus
Configuration overview  
We create special Loopback for overlay, announce it to BGP Underlay    
For every VLAN where clients are connected we configure VNI  
Next we configure nve interface, where we configure peers for every VNI

```

#Enables VTEP (only required on Leaf or Border)

  member vni 200
    ingress-replication protocol static
      peer-ip 10.10.2.4
      peer-ip 10.10.2.5
```

### BGP EVPN on Nexus - VLAN based service
Configuration overview  
- MAC VRF for every VLAN, 
- Special loopback for Overlay is created. From this overlay address we build l2vpn adjacency with Spines and send then only l2vpn route updates   
- For overlay neighbor we configure sending all communities, do not change next hop and multihop 
- On  leafs we configure BGP as host reachability protocol and as ingress replication protocol 
- Also we configure for each VNI RD, RT in evpn section. RD can be any, it is better to use loopbackIP:VNI for it, for better understanding when we see it in routing table. RT can be any as well, but it should be correlated what we import and export on all VTEPS, so it is better to do it the same on all VTEPS for one VNI
- This type of configuration will require configuration for every VLAN, if we have 1000 VLANs
- Route Type 2 dissapears, when host does not send any traffic for some time and disspears from switch MAC table, after this withdrawl is sent

## VLAN aware
Configuration overview  
We create VLAN aware bundle with RD, RT and put all VLANS into it, for example 1-1000, this is a major pro.
In this mode, in Route type 2, in NLRI path attribite in BGP update there will be Ethernet TAG ID - the same as VNI

## EVPN
- Ethernet VPN (EVPN) is a technology for carrying layer 2 Ethernet traffic as a virtual private network using wide area network protocols. EVPN technologies include Ethernet over MPLS and Ethernet over VXLAN
- AFI 25, SAFI 70
- EVPN - is an address family used in MP BGP, MP BGP is transport for it
- RFC 7432 - EVPN over MPLS
- RFC 8365 - EVPN over VXLAN
- RFC 7623 - Provider Backbone Bridges
- Dynamic discover of new VTEPs
- Dynamic learning of MAC and IP information
- Decrease amount of BUM traffic
- Providing host mobility
- Providing multi-homing for active active connections - one host to several switches without any VPC
- We establish eBGP or iBGP sessions between leafs and spines. If BGP session is used for underlay, than it will be the second session via separate Loopback interfaces. This new BGP session uses only l2vpn address family
- It is recomended to use separate Loopbacks for l2vpn BGP adjecency and nve interface, vendors recomend
- When l2vpn BGP update is sent, nve interface IP is used as nexthop
- eBGP is better because if we have superspines we will have to configure hierarchical design for RR

## Inside EVPN packet
- Type: Update message (2)
- Path attributes:
  - Origin: IGP 
  - AS_PATH
  - MP_REACH_NLRI
    - Address Family Identifier (AFI) - Layer-2 VPN - 25
    - Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) - EVPN - 70
    - Nexthop - lookback IP
    - Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)
      - EVPN NLRI
        - Route type: MAC advertisment route (2)
        - Route Distinguisher
        - Ethernet TAG ID - 0
        - MAC address
        - VNI - it can be MPLS label here
- Extended communities
  - Route target
  - Encapsulation - VXLAN - because it can work via MPLS as well
  - Sequence number - the more the better, used when host moves from one VTEP to another, new VTEP increases this number and sends to everyone

## EVPN route types
VTEP gets all BGP updates and stores them in global table, but installs them to VRF only if there is required VNI.  
In the beginning just after configuration is finished only Type routes are sent to all l2vpn neighbors, announcing that VTEP is ready to process BUM traffic. Type 2 routes will appear only after client hosts will start to generate traffic.
- L2 operations
  - Type 2 - Host Advertisment - advertising MACs - Generated when new MAC is discovered, is sento all VTEPs withis this VNI, VTEPs import it to required MAC VRF according to RT
  - Type 3 - Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag  - for BUM - Ingress Replication - VTEP with particular VNI and VLAN sends this update to inform everyone that it is ready to accept BUM traffic for this particular VNI. Attribute PMSI_TUNNEL_ATTRIBUTE is added to BGP update, it contains VNI and replication type: Ingress Replication (or Multicast). This route update is generated for every VNI configured.
- L3 operations
  - Type 4 - Ethernet Segment Route - one LAN connected to two VTEPs - only one of them should process BUM
  - Type 1 - Ethernet Auto Discovery Route
- External connections
  - Type 5 - IP prefix route advertisment
- Multicast
  - Type 6,7,8 - PIM, IGMP Leave/Join

### Route type 3
In general route update message looks like typical BGP update:

## Layer 3
- Bridged overlay
- Edge-Routed Bridging

### Bridged overlay
- Default gateway is outside fabric (firewall)
- All routing and L3 termination is outside fabric
- Fabric - is a large logic L2 switch
- Pros: segmentation, simplicity
- Cons: non-optimal traffic flow, no ARP suppression
- VLAN based segmentation
- Rarely used

### Edge-Routed Bridging
- Default Gateway - VTEP
- VRF based segmentation
- Pros: optimal traffic flow, ARP suppression
- Cons: expensive equipment
- Fabric: big L3 Switch - MLS
- Intra VRF traffic may go via Firewall

## IRB - Integrated Routing and Bridging
It means that 2 services are provided at the same time: Routing and switching

### Assymetric

- Routing on ingress VTEP: Leaf1 gets frame in VLAN/VNI 1, and puts it to MAC VRF 2 according to destination IP and this packet with new VNI goes to LEAF 2
```
Host 1 (SRC MAC: Host 1; DST MAC: VLAN 1) > Leaf 1 > MAC VRF 1 VNI/VLAN 1 > MAC VRF 2 VNI/VLAN 2 (SRC MAC: VLAN 2; DST MAC: Host 2)> VXLAN > Leaf 2 > MAC VRF 2 > Host 2
```
- On egress VTEP only switching
- Assymetric: different VNIs on different directions of one flow: From Leaf 1 to Leaf 2 traffic is VNI2, and from Leaf 2 to Leaf 1 traffic is VNI1
- All VNI-VLANs should be configured on all VTEPs - Con - poor scalability
- VRF-lite: Because info about VRFs is not spreaded across fabric
- Pros: low latency - TTL-1 and routing decision happens only once on ingress VTEP , simplicity
- Changing MAC: the same as in traditional routing: SRC MAC is changed VLAN SVI MAC and DST MAC is Changed to Destination Host Mac  
- Route Type 2 is used, besides MAC it also transfers IP/MAC bindings in the same NLRI, VNI is included in both routes. MAC update is imported into MAC table and IP/MAC update is imported into ARP table of destination MAC VRF

### Symmetric
- Routing happends both on ingress and egress VTEP: Leaf1 gets frame in VLAN/VNI 1, puts it to IP VRF A, IP VRF sends it to Leaf 2 with VNI of this VRF, Leaf 2 puts it into proper MAC VRF
```
Host 1 (SRC MAC: Host 1; DST MAC: VLAN 1) > Leaf 1 > MAC VRF 1 VNI/VLAN 1 > IP VRF A> VXLAN VNI 555 > Leaf 2 > IP VRF A > MAC VRF 2 > Host 2
```
- Symmetric: one L3VNI for both directions of traffic flow
- Routing through IP VRF, VNI configuration should not be the same on all VTEPs, we configure on VTEP only VLANS which are connected to it, we do not have to configure VLANS and VNIs for VLANS which are only on different VTEP
- One IP VRF may include several MAC VRFs
- Full VRF
- Pros: scalability, integration with out networks - this is main pro, external router peers with IP VRF
- Cons: 2 TTLs
