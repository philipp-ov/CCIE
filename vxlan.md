# VxLAN & EVPN
Everything I need to know about VxLAN/EVPN in an extremely structured, brief language, that I understand the most
 
## Prerequisites of new approach: VxLAN and EVPN
- DC used Layer 2 technologies such as xSTP and MC-LAG
- xSTP blocks ports
- MC-LAG may not provide enough redundancy
- Device outage is a significant event and larger modular-chassis devices use a lot of power
- Amount of VLANs limit

## VxLAN concepts   
- RFC 7348
- VXLAN (Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network) is a Layer 2 overlay technology over a Layer 3 underlay infrastructure. It provides a means to stretch the Layer 2 network by pro- viding a tunneling encapsulation using MAC addresses in UDP (MAC in UDP) over an IP underlay. It is used to carry the MAC traffic from the individual VMs in an encapsulated format over a logical “tunnel”
- UDP encapsulation, port 4789, 50 bytes overhead
- MTU for transport underlay network should be large - 1550 bytes minimum, maybe even Jumbo Frames
- Only transport requirement is unicast IP
- VLAN numbers can be different on all switches, but VNI number should be the same 
- Default gateway can be any device in a fabric
- VxLAN does not encapsulate CDP, STP....
- VxLAN cannot do traffic engineering, that is why MPLS is better
- VxLAN L2 is the same as VPLS
- VxLAN tunnels are not statefull - no keepalives
- VxLAN producers - Huawei, Juniper, Nexus 9k and Arista
- VNID - Vxlan Network Identifier - defines broadcast segment - transfered in VxLAN header - 3 bytes
- NVE - Network Virtualization Edge - interface where VXLAN ends - only 1 NVE interface is allowed on the switch.
- VTEP - VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint - Nexus - Leaf
- EVI - EVPN Virtual Instance
- Addresses the limitation of 4094 VLANs, allows 16M networks via VNI
- All paths are used via ECMP, UDP source port entropy ensures efficient load balancing
- Semaless moving VMs across DC
- L2 implementation - our fabric is a big L2 switch - VTEP knows nothing about IP addresses, only MAC addresses and where they are located (VTEP IP address)
- L2 + L3 - in addition to L2 (big switch) we add functionality of big L3 router (MLS - multi layered switch), with one VRF inside it or several...
- Load balancing: Nexus uses hash of (src ip, dst ip, protocol, src port, dst port) for ECMP load balancing underlay traffic, in VxLAN packets all these fields are the same, except UDP source port which is based on hash of inside VxLAN packet, thanks to this load balancing works good, that is why UDP is used, not direct IP for example

### Modes of learning MACs
- Flood and learn - no control plane - VTEP sends BUM traffic everywhere it is configured and then listens for reply, based on this learns where which MAC is located. First packet (ARP) and broadcast are sent to all peers, configured for this VNI. All next packets are sent only to particular VTEP. VxLAN packets between leafs are load balanced between spines. Host A in VLAN 1 SVI 1 sends ARP request for Host B in VLAN 2 svi 1. VTEP 1 encapsulates this ARP request to VXLAN and sends it to peer VTEPs for this SVI. VTEP 2 replies, and then all other traffic goes between these 2 VTEPs
- EVPN - VTEPs exchange data about MACs and IP addresses

### BUM traffic
Can be processed in 2 ways:
- Multicast replication for BUM/Flood and learn for MAC - multicast is enabled on Underlay - BUM is not packed inside VxlAN - it is sent via Underlay - replication point is on rendezvous point - spine - it is difficult to configure multicast on Underlay - not used today. Host sends broadcast. Leaf forwards it without VXLAN as a multicast to 225.2.2.1. We configure a match between VNI and multicast address - only one multicast packet - Spines will propogate it to all subscribers - load is much less then ingress replication
- Ingress replication for BUM- packed to VxLAN - and sent to all in VNI - configured statically: for every VNI we configure VTEPs IPs which have the same VNI - or we chaeck for BUM subscribtion (Route Type 3) in EVPN table

### Host mobility
- VM moves from one VTEP to another and continue
- VTEP-2 creates route type 2 with higher Sequence Number
- All other VTEPs get a new route
- Route with higher sequence number wins
- Problems may appear if MAC is configured staticly on port

## EVPN

### Concepts
- Ethernet VPN (EVPN) is a technology for carrying layer 2 Ethernet traffic as a virtual private network using wide area network protocols. EVPN technologies include Ethernet over MPLS and Ethernet over VXLAN
- AFI 25, SAFI 70
- EVPN - is an address family used in MP BGP, MP BGP is transport for it
- RFC 7432 - EVPN over MPLS
- RFC 8365 - EVPN over VXLAN
- RFC 7623 - Provider Backbone Bridges
- Dynamic discover of new VTEPs
- Dynamic learning of MAC and IP information
- Decrease amount of BUM traffic
- EVPN table contains: IP, MAC, L3 VNI, L2 VNI, Next hop
- Providing host mobility
- Providing multi-homing for active active connections - one host to several switches without any VPC
- We establish eBGP or iBGP sessions between leafs and spines. If BGP session is used for underlay, than it will be the second session via separate Loopback interfaces. This new BGP session uses only l2vpn address family
- It is recomended to use separate Loopbacks for l2vpn BGP adjecency and nve interface, vendors recomend
- When l2vpn BGP update is sent, nve interface IP is used as nexthop
- eBGP is better because if we have superspines we will have to configure hierarchical design for RR

### EVPN route types
VTEP gets all BGP updates and stores them in global table, but installs them to VRF only if there is required VNI.  
In the beginning just after configuration is finished only Type 3 routes are sent to all l2vpn neighbors, announcing that VTEP is ready to process BUM traffic. Type 2 routes will appear only after client hosts will start to generate traffic.
- L2 operations
  - Type 2 - Host Advertisment - advertising MACs - Generated when new MAC is discovered, is sent to all VTEPs within this VNI, VTEPs import it to required MAC VRF according to RT - also advertise IP together with MAC - this is a separate update called MAC/IP it is sent when new record appears in ARP table of VRF where VLAN interface is and this record ic connected with this VLAN interface - this MAC/IP update is used for assymetric routing of VxLAN traffic
  - Type 3 - Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag  - for BUM - Ingress Replication - VTEP with particular VNI and VLAN sends this update to inform everyone that it is ready to accept BUM traffic for this particular VNI. Attribute PMSI_TUNNEL_ATTRIBUTE is added to BGP update, it contains VNI and replication type: Ingress Replication (or Multicast). This route update is generated for every VNI configured.
- L3 operations
  - Type 4 - Ethernet Segment Route - one LAN connected to two VTEPs - only one of them should process BUM
  - Type 1 - Ethernet Auto Discovery Route
- External connections
  - Type 5 - IP prefix route advertisment - when we peer IP VRF on VTEP with external router, routes from this router will be type 5
- Multicast
  - Type 6,7,8 - PIM, IGMP Leave/Join

### Inside EVPN packet
- Type: Update message (2)
- Path attributes:
  - Origin: IGP 
  - AS_PATH
  - MP_REACH_NLRI
    - Address Family Identifier (AFI) - Layer-2 VPN - 25
    - Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) - EVPN - 70
    - Nexthop - lookback IP
    - Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)
      - EVPN NLRI
        - Route type: MAC advertisment route (2)
        - Route Distinguisher
        - Ethernet TAG ID - 0
        - MAC address
        - VNI - it can be MPLS label here
- Extended communities
  - Route target
  - Encapsulation - VXLAN - because it can work via MPLS as well
  - Sequence number - the more the better, used when host moves from one VTEP to another, new VTEP increases this number and sends to everyone

### Route type 3
In general route update message looks like typical BGP update:
```
Border Gateway Protocol - UPDATE Message
    Marker: ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
    Length: 99
    Type: UPDATE Message (2)
    Withdrawn Routes Length: 0

## L2
- Fabric is a big Switch
- For every VLAN we configure VNI and MAC VRF
- Default Gateway for host is outside fabric
- We configure NVE interface with all VNIs, BUM traffic configuration, and hosts learning type

### Implementation types
- VLAN based service: one VLAN - one MAC VRF (RT, RD) - one bridge table, Ethernet Tag = 0 - one VNI - forwarding based on VNI - most popular - good for multi vendor - one subnet per EVI - EVPN route type 2
- VLAN bundle service - one bridge table, MAC VRF with RT RD for all VLANs - frames are sent with 802.1Q - Ethernet Tag = 0, MACs in different VLANs should not match
- VLAN aware bundle service - not supported by all vendors - all VLANs have one VRF(RT, RD) - every VLAN has its own bridge table with VNI and Ethernet tag = VNI. We create VLAN aware bundle with RD, RT and put all VLANS into it, for example 1-1000, this is a major pro. In this mode, in Route type 2, in NLRI path attribite in BGP update there will be Ethernet TAG ID - the same as VNI.

### Operations overview - VLAN based
- Host A is online, Leaf-1 sees its MAC and forwards Route Type 2 to all other VTEPS, and now all VTEPs know that Host A is behind Leaf-1
- Host A in VLAN 1 VNI 1 sends ARP request for Host B in VLAN 1 VNI 1
- Leaf 1 sends this ARP request in VXLAN to all VTEPs from which it got Route Type 3 - Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag with VNI 1
- All VTEPs which got ARP, forward it to all physical ports in this NVI
- Host B replies and Leaf 2 sends reply in VXLAN to Leaf 1

### MAC VRF
- RD:MAC-PREFIX:ETI
- RD:IP-PREFIX:ETI
- MAC-PREFIX = MAC/48
- Ethernet Tag ID = 0 - in most cases - defines bridge table inside VRF - several bridge tables can be in one vrf - in most cases we add 1 vlan to one MAC VRF, this is required only when several VLANs are in 1 MAC VRF
- We add VLAN to MAC VRF instead of interface in IP VRF

### Firewall/Deafult gateway injection
- Connected to border leaf via TRUNK interface
- All required subinterfaces are configured on firewall
- On all required clients we configure firewall as a default gateway
- All traffic between VLANs goes via firewall
- Bottle neck for the entire network
- High load on border leaf
- ePBR can be also used

### Configuration overview for L2
- Pure L2 configuration for VxLAN traffic, no L3, no routing
- MAC VRF for every VLAN 
- Special loopback for Overlay is created. From this overlay address we build l2vpn adjacency with Spines and send then only l2vpn route updates   
- For overlay neighbor we configure sending all communities, do not change next hop and multihop 
- On  leafs we configure BGP as host reachability protocol and as ingress replication protocol 
- Also we configure for each VNI RD, RT in evpn section. RD can be any, it is better to use loopbackIP:VNI for it, for better understanding when we see it in routing table. RT can be any as well, but it should be correlated what we import and export on all VTEPS, so it is better to do it the same on all VTEPS for one VNI
- This type of configuration will require configuration for every VLAN, if we have 1000 VLANs
- Route Type 2 dissapears, when host does not send any traffic for some time and disspears from switch MAC table, after this withdrawl is sent

## L3
- IRB - Integrated Routing and Bridging - It means that 2 services are provided at the same time: Routing and switching
- To isolate from Underlay we use VRfs for VxLAN routing

**Distributed anycast gateway**
- One default GW on all leafs for particular VLAN - Virtual IP
- One MAC for default GW on all leafs - Virtual MAC
- On all leafs we configure manually on Interface VLAN virtual IP and virtual MAC
- In route updates type 2 which contains MAC/IP real router mac is sent, not virtual one

**ARP suppression**
- Decrease BUM traffic
- VTEP intercepts all ARP traffic, if it has Type 2 route for it, it replies - ARP spoofing
- If no route for it, then it sends BUM traffic to fabric

**Implementation types - where VXLAN routing happens:**
- Bridged overlay - routing on external device
- Centrally-Routed Bridging (Spine Routed) - not recomended
- Edge-Routed Bridging (Leaf routed) - recomended

### Bridged overlay - no L3 functionality
- Does not provide a mechanism for inter-VXLAN routing functionality within the fabric
- Default gateway is outside fabric (firewall)
- All routing and L3 termination is outside fabric
- Fabric - is a large logic L2 switch
- Pros: segmentation, simplicity
- Cons: non-optimal traffic flow, no ARP suppression
- VLAN based segmentation
- Rarely used

### Edge-Routed Bridging
- Default Gateway - VTEP
- VRF based segmentation
- Pros: optimal traffic flow, ARP suppression
- Cons: expensive equipment
- Fabric: big L3 Switch - MLS
- Intra VRF traffic may go via Firewall

#### Edge-Routed Bridging - Assymetric
- Only L2VNI is used
- Does not require any specific configuration: just add VRF and SVI interfaces, maybe if you want, add virtual MAC, that's all
- Routing on ingress VTEP: Leaf1 gets frame in VLAN/VNI 1, and puts it to MAC VRF 2 according to destination IP and this packet with new VNI goes to LEAF 2
```
Host 1 (SRC MAC: Host 1; DST MAC: VLAN 1) > Leaf 1 > MAC VRF 1 VNI/VLAN 1 > MAC VRF 2 VNI/VLAN 2 (SRC MAC: VLAN 2; DST MAC: Host 2)> VXLAN > Leaf 2 > MAC VRF 2 > Host 2
```
- On egress VTEP only switching
- Assymetric: different VNIs on different directions of one flow: From Leaf 1 to Leaf 2 traffic is VNI2, and from Leaf 2 to Leaf 1 traffic is VNI1
- All VNI-VLANs should be configured on all VTEPs - Con - poor scalability - if on one VTEP no conf of VLAN, it will be black holed
- VRF-lite: Because info about VRFs is not spreaded across fabric
- Pros: low latency - TTL-1 and routing decision happens only once on ingress VTEP , simplicity
- Changing MAC: the same as in traditional routing: SRC MAC is changed VLAN SVI MAC and DST MAC is Changed to Destination Host Mac  
- Route Type 2 is used, besides MAC it also transfers IP/MAC bindings in the same NLRI, VNI is included in both routes. MAC update is imported into MAC table and IP/MAC update is imported into ARP table of destination MAC VRF

**Configuration overview (in addition to L2):**
- We need just to configure IP interface: we create VRF and add VLAN interfaces to it and add virtual IP and virtual MAC for them
- Virtual MAC is configured one per switch
- All VTEPs must have the same virtual MAC address
- Enable ARP suppression for every vni in nve interface - maybe not needed on Nexus
- Enable anycast distributed gateway on all VLAN interfaces - maybe no needed on Nexus

#### Edge-Routed Bridging - Symmetric
- Routing happends both on ingress and egress VTEP: Leaf1 gets frame in VLAN/VNI 1, puts it to IP VRF A, IP VRF sends it to Leaf 2 with VNI of this VRF, Leaf 2 puts it into proper MAC VRF
```
Host 1 (SRC MAC: Host 1; DST MAC: VLAN 1) > Leaf 1 > MAC VRF 1 VNI/VLAN 1 > IP VRF A (SRC MAC: VLAN 1; DST MAC: VLAN 2) > VXLAN VNI 555 > Leaf 2 > IP VRF A > MAC VRF 2 (SRC MAC: VLAN 2; DST MAC: HOST 2) > Host 2
```
- Symmetric: one L3VNI for both directions of traffic flow
- Routing through IP VRF, VNI configuration should not be the same on all VTEPs, we configure on VTEP only VLANS which are connected to it, we do not have to configure VLANS and VNIs for VLANS which are only on different VTEP
- One IP VRF may include several MAC VRFs
- Full VRF
- Pros: scalability, integration with out networks - this is main pro, external router peers with IP VRF
- Cons: 2 TTLs
- Route Type 2 is used, besides MAC it also transfers IP/MAC bindings in the same NLRI, VNI is included in both routes. MAC update is imported into MAC table and IP/MAC update is imported into ARP table of destination MAC VRF + into routing table
- MAC-IP routing update contains two RT: for MAC VRF (first one) and IP VRF; and 2 VNIs: the first one for switching and second one for routing
- MAC-IP also contains Router MAC (as an extended community) for routing: MAC of VLAN 2 in our example, so VTEP-1 knows what change MAC to before sendong to VTEP-2

**Configuration overview (in addition to Assymetric)**
- Add route target and RD to IP VRF
- Add L3 VNI to each VRF - Create fake VLAN and fake SVI for it
- Add anycast gateway to each SVI
- Add L3 VNI to NVE interface

## Configuration

### Static peers on Nexus - flood and learn, no EVPN
Configuration overview  
- We create special Loopback for overlay, announce it to BGP Underlay    
- For every VLAN where clients are connected we configure VNI  
- Next we configure nve interface, where we configure peers for every VNI
- Only L2 for VxLAN traffic, no L3 and no BGP
