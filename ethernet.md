# Ethernet

## History and overview
- Invented by Xerox in 1973
- First standard - 1985 - IEEE 802.3
- 802.3 Ethernet and initial Ethernet are different
- Alohanet - developed in University of Hawaii - in 1971 - radio - Ethernet is based on it
- Cable was coaxial - one very long cable - all computers and printers on PaloAlto Xerox research center were connected to it
- Initially was half-duplex
- 2.94 Mb/s, version 2 - 10 Mb/s
- 1995 - FastEthernet - 802.3u - 100 Mbit/s
- Robert Methalf - creator of 3Com
- 1998 - Gigabit Ethernet
- 2002 - 10 Gb/s - Fiber only
- 2010 - 802.3ba - 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s
- Physical layer: media specifications + Physical signalling sublayer
- Data link layer: Media Access Control sublayer (MAC) + Logical Link Control sublayer (LLC)
- LLC is not covered by Ethernet standard, it is covered in 802.2, it describes how multiple Layer 3 protocols can interact with multiple Layer 2 technologies, not only Ethernet

## CSMA/CD
- No need any more
- Simplex - only one side speaks
- Half-Duplex - one talks, other keeps silence
- Full-Duplex - both talks
CS - Carrier Sense  
Carrier - it's a signal  
Perform Carrier Sense - listening for signal on the wire, if it is free, wait for a time - inter frame gap - 9 microseconds(the faster the Ethernet the smaller this time) - then send bits on the wire  
MA - Multiple Access -  we can send many frames one by one - not all old technologies could afford it  
CD - Collision Detect - when I speak, I also listen - if I get something during sending it is a collision  
Collision transforms signals to meaningless garbage  
If a host detects a collision - it stops everything and  sends a JAM sequence - everybody on the cable recognises it as a sign of a collision  
After JAM hosts have to wait for a random backoff timer  

## Physical layer standards
T - UTP - Unshielded twisted pair  
X - fiber  
100 - Speed  
BASE - Baseband - means that entire cable is used  
At the end there also maybe a number in old standards - it means maximum cable length  
Pair is twisted because it reduces EMI - Electromagnetic Influence  
RJ-45 - it is a connector, mostly used, SFP connector can also be used
- 10 Mbps - Ethernet - 10BASE-T - 802.3 - Copper - 100 m
- 100 Mbps - Fast Ethernet - 100BASE-T - 802.3u - Copper - 100 m
- 1000 Mbps - Gigabit Ethernet - 1000BASE-LX - 802.3z - Fiber - 5000 m
- 1000 Mbps - Gigabit Ethernet - 1000BASE-T - 802.3ab - Cooper - 100 m
- 10 Gbps - 10 Gig Ethernet - 10GBASE-T - 802.3an - Cooper - 100 m
If we connect two devices on one level of OSI model then we use crossover cable: switch-switch hub-hub router-router  
If we connect two devices on different levels of OSI model, then we use straight-through cable: router-switch, hub-PC, switch-hub  
Crossover acble: 1 goes to 3, 2 goes to 6  
Auto MDI-X technology on adapters switch automatically to correct cable type  
The UTP cables differ in the following parameters:
- Twists per centimeter - the more the better protection against EMI
- Sheath thickness
Categories:
- Cat 5 - 100 Mbs
- Cat 5e - 1 Gbps
- Cat 6 - 10 Gbps - 55 meters
- Cat 6a - 10 Gbps
- Cat 7/7a - 10 Gbps
- Cat 8 - 40 Gbits - 30 meters  

STP - Shielded Twisted Pair - covered with foil

## Auto-Negotiation
- 802.3u - clause 28
- Before auto negotiation after inserting a cable network interface sent an electric pulse and interface on other end had a green light
- Then they encoded supported speeds in this pulse - auto-negotiation - 16 bits long - every bit for its own speed - other end replies with its options and acknowledgements
- Negotiation: speed, duplex, flow control
- Enabled everywhere by default and very stable nowdays

## Frame
- Preamble - 7 bits - to synch receiver
- Start of frame


## Jumbo frames

## Pause frames

## Flow control

## Cabling

## Ethernet interface
- scopeid
- txqueuelen
- errors - CRC failures on receipt of a frame: bad cable, bad interface, bad switch
- drops - IPv6, VLANs
- overrruns
- frame
- carrier
- collision
